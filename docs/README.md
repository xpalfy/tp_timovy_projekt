# Web Application for Historical Handwritten Documents Processing

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a web application designed to process historical handwritten documents, including encrypted texts and substitution cipher keys. The application leverages simulated AI modules built on the .NET platform, with Python used for AI simulations. This setup allows for future integration of real AI models, enhancing the application's capabilities in document analysis.

## Features

- **Document Classification**: Classifies uploaded documents as either encrypted texts or substitution cipher keys using a simulated AI module.
- **Text Localization and Transcription**: Localizes and transcribes encrypted texts, preparing them for decryption.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts texts using brute-force algorithms or user-uploaded substitution cipher keys.
- **Cipher Key Analysis**: Localizes and classifies substitution systems, detects substitution items, and maps plain text to cipher text.
- **Key Compatibility**: Allows users to apply new cipher keys to existing encrypted texts to check compatibility and vice versa.
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Guides new users on how to effectively use the system through an interactive tutorial.

## Technical Specifications

- **Front-End**: Responsive and visually appealing interface to enhance user experience.
- **Back-End**: Communicates with Python-based AI modules and implements JWT Bearer authorization for security.
- **Data Management**: Allows users to save their progress and resume work at a later time.
